                                    <h4>Chapter Two: How Hackers Can Breach You</h4>
<p>Breaching is bad for you and the servers the hacker has access to. If the hacker gets your account then the hacker will most likely use your account to hack on popular servers such as Mineplex or Hypixel. It can happen to anyone, day or night the hackers will always be there. Here are some of the most commen ways that a hacker may be able to access your account.</p>
<p>Unsecure Passwords - Insecure passwords are the most commen way that a hacker can access your account. Passwords that are easy to crack are most likely the ones that will be stolen so make sure that it is not a commen thing such as a sport or a pet such as a dog or a cat. Also make sure that your password is not something such as 123abc . That is the most insecure password of all time and hackers will most likely get you first because your password is the easiest. The most commen passwords are</p>
<p>- 123456</p> 
<p>- password</p>
<p>- 12345678</p>
<p>- qwerty</p>
<p>- 12345</p>
<p>- 123456789</p>
<p>- football</p>
<p>- 1234</p>
<p>- 1234567</p>
<p>- baseball</p>
<p>If you are using any of the passwords listed above then its time to change your password to something more secure. A hacker can easily get into your account and they will get you banned from some of your most favorite popular servers. Make sure that they cannot crack it within 1 day. If possible make sure that it takes them years to crack it.</p>
<p>Fake Websites - If you are visiting a website that shows things like "Free Mineplex Ranks!" or "Free Hypixel Coins!" then do not be fooled. Many people have been breached by inserting their username and password and giving information to these hackers for generations. Do not insert your username and password on ANY Minecraft website exept for minecraft.net and mojang.com if you already have then go to Chapter 3. Remember, if you get hacked, a hacker can do anything to your account such as change your skin or password so you cannot get in. Also .wix.com and .weebly.com extentions are the most commen for fake websites.</p>
<p>Fake Emails - A hacker can get into your account by sending you a fake email by mojang but luckily most email services such as Outlook and Gmail send these fake emails to the Junk or Spam folders. If you do tend to run into one of these do not click it. It can lead to the hacker gaining information about your account and about you. This also goes for anything else that might have fake emails.</p>
<p>Hacked Databases - If a hacker can get into the minecraft database then they can steal and leak your minecraft accounts password to another hacker and everyone can be affected by this. Remember to change your passwords every now and then!</p>
<p>Remember, even if you have the best security ever you can still be hacked! Be careful of what the internet says! The internet can lie you know!</p>
                                      <h5>Chapter 3 : If you have been a victim</h5>
<p>If you are a victim of a breach then do not fear. You still have time to make sure that they dont get your account. Follow these methods on getting your account back.</p>
<p>Change your password - If you still have access then you can change your password to a more secure password. That will reverse the breach. If you use the same password exept with some different letters or numbers or symbols then they will easily be able to gain access again. I recommend changing it to something else completly.</p>
<p>Contact Mojang - The best thing to do if you cannot access your account is go into your email account that you signed up with and email Mojang's help email to help recover your account. They will help you get your account back from the breacher. It might take some time but be paitent, it takes time for them to give it back to you as they will have to ask you for a different password. Just follow whatever they want you to do. Remember, do not contact a fake Mojang help email otherwise that will just get you in more trouble then you already are.</p>
<p>Delete Your Account - This might be sad for you but if nothing works and you have access to your account, you should delete it. It will make sure that they do not get a account. Besides Minecraft accounts are only $25.00 USD. You can easily buy another account or even more than 1 as a backup account.</p>
                                        <h6>Chapter 4: Websites that can help you with passwords</h6>
<p>Websites that can show passwords that are commenly used or help secure a password even more are very helpful. Make sure that they do not save your password to their servers. If they do they can access your account too so do not use fishy or shady websites that show the protection of your password.</p>
